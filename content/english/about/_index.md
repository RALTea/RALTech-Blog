I'm a 24-year-old developer with a passion for creating beautiful, high-performance web experiences. My journey into code started with a curiosity for how things work, and it has evolved into a career focused on building intuitive and efficient applications.


#### My Approach to Building for the Web
I believe in pragmatic solutions and clean code. My goal is always to build products that are not just functional, but also a joy to use, maintain, and scale.

#### Focusing on product, not on tech
I focus on delivering value to users, not on the technology stack. I choose Svelte for its remarkable development speed. It allows me to build and ship the same rich, interactive features much faster, thanks to its minimal boilerplate and truly reactive nature. This means less time wrestling with the framework and more time delivering value.
